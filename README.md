**Build**

Recommended : python3

Please run the following commands to build the code.

1. **cd CodingChallenge_shravan**
2. Run **sh buid.sh**  if you are on Linux
or Run **sh buid_mac.sh** if you are on Mac. (Please provide the password if asked)

At this point the commandline utility will be added to your system.. You can go  ahead and use it.

For example :

**reconstruct-document --lexicon files/lex.txt --document files/input.txt --output files/sample.txt**

Now your sample.txt will have your required output.



**Testing**:

Please make sure you have pytest installed. Otherwise please follow the instructions here :https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html

1. Make sure that you have built the code before running this (sh build.sh).

2. Just run the command  **pytest** inside CodingChallenge_shravan
